# MySQL Configuration for Performance, Security, and Stability
# ===================================================================
#
# This MySQL configuration is optimized for better performance and 
# stability. Key settings have been adjusted for handling large datasets, 
# optimizing InnoDB, improving query performance, and ensuring that 
# the MySQL server is secure and efficient. These configurations 
# are ideal for high-traffic web hosting, e-commerce, and large database 
# environments.
