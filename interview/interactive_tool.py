#      An interactive quiz that captures Userâ€™s responses to pre-defined multiple
#      choice questions. The quiz presents 10 questions with 4 choices each.
#      Questions are shown in a random order, and the user can quit at any time.
#      Upon completion or early exit, the script summarizes the responses.
#
# Requirements:
#   - Python 3.x
#   - Libraries:
#       - requests
#       - beautifulsoup4
#
# Usage:

# Notes:
#   Interactive Tool Specification:
#
#   Develop an interactive tool to capture Userâ€™s responses to pre-defined questions (10 multiple choice questions).
#   Application should ask questions to the User with 4 choices to choose answer from, and User will either provide 
#   a response or quit the process. Upon completion of 10 questions or Userâ€™s quit action - whichever is first, 
#   show Question and Responses the User has provided.
#   - 10 questions will be pre-defined - with 4 choices to select an answer from
#   - Application will not ask these questions in a serialized manner (or reverse order)
#   - Define 10 questions with 4 allowed answers in the data format you are comfortable with
# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------
